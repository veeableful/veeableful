### Heya there! 👋

I'm a backpacking digital nomad who happens to have some software development skills. My favorite programming languages are C (the OG!), Go, and Rust. I like to draw ✏️  and recently picked up the Violin 🎻. I have [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/5722534) though I haven't been uploading recently but I hope to get back into it soon 🤞
