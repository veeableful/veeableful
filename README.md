I started a Pixiv page recently at https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/5722534. There's not much there yet but I plan to continue drawing new things to put on it!
I also just created a Behance page at https://www.behance.net/veeableful where I will put my cut-out versions of my illustrations in the form of wallpapers!
